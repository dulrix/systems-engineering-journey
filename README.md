Who I am

I am a student rebuilding my academic and technical foundation with a focus on engineering systems. After early setbacks, I made a deliberate decision to reset, work with discipline, and build real technical depth through projects and consistent execution.

Why Electrical Engineering + Computer Science

I am interested in the intersection of hardware and software — how physical systems are modeled, controlled, and optimized using code. Electrical Engineering gives me the understanding of signals, power, and systems, while Computer Science gives me the tools to analyze data, design algorithms, and build scalable solutions. Together, they allow me to solve real-world problems, not just theoretical ones.

What I am building over the next 18 months

Over the next 18 months, I am building a portfolio of engineering projects focused on systems and computation. This includes simulation-based energy and power analysis projects, embedded and systems-oriented software, and progressively more complex technical work that demonstrates problem-solving, design thinking, and technical maturity. All work will be documented with code, analysis, and reflection.

My goal

My goal is to become a strong engineering student prepared for rigorous academic environments and to apply to top global universities for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am focused on long-term growth, intellectual depth, and building things that have real technical substance.
