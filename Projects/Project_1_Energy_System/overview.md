# Project 1: Smart Energy & Power Analysis System (Simulation-Based)

## Problem statement
I want to model and analyze energy usage in a simple electrical system using simulation and code. The goal is to understand how voltage, current, and power behave over time and how we can detect inefficiency or unusual patterns from data.

## Why it matters
Energy efficiency and power monitoring matter in homes, industries, and power grids. This project builds fundamentals in electrical concepts (V, I, P, energy) and shows how software can be used to analyze and improve real systems.

## What I will simulate
- A simplified load profile over time (example: device or home power usage)
- Voltage and current signals (synthetic data at first)
- Power calculation: P(t) = V(t) × I(t)
- Energy consumption over time

## Tools I will use
- Python
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Final output
- Code that generates data and computes power + energy
- Graphs (power vs time, energy vs time)
- A short written summary of findings and next steps
