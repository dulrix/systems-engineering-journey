## Summary – Project 1: Energy Simulation

### What I simulated
I simulated a simple electrical system over a 24-hour period with constant voltage and time-varying current.

### What the graphs show
The current varies sinusoidally throughout the day, and the power follows the same pattern since power depends on current.

### One thing I learned
I learned how voltage, current, and power are related over time and how to model this relationship using code.

### One improvement idea
A future improvement would be to make the voltage vary with time instead of being constant.
